# ShoppingCart
Problem Statement :

Using Java, write a simple program that calculates the price of a basket of shopping.

The solution should be accomplished in roughly two hours.

Items are presented one at a time, in a list, identified by name - for example "Apple" or "Banana".

Multiple items are present multiple times in the list, so for example ["Apple", "Apple", "Banana"] is a basket with two apples and one banana.
 
Items are priced as follows:

 - Apples are 35p each
 - Bananas are 20p each
 - Melons are 50p each, but are available as ‘buy one get one free’
 - Limes are 15p each, but are available in a ‘three for the price of two’ offer

Given a list of shopping, calculate the total cost of those items.

Solution:

A sample of shopping cart having some methods to scan item and calculate total price.
